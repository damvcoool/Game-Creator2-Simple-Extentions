# GameCreator2 Simple Extensions
In this respository I will upload code I use in Game Creator 2 that cannot be uploaded to the Hub.

A few of the extensions are:
- Extended Unit Driver controllers for the Player and Characters
- Input Usage actions
- Micro Extensions or Micro Modules
  - Simple Melee
  - Simple Dialogue
  - Simple Pause

Things I will not include:
- Instructions uploaded to the Hub
- Game Creator 2 Core code, or code in the modules

## Requirements
To take advantage of the code and samples on this repository you will need the following:
- Unity 2022.1
- [Game Creator 2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/game-creator-2-203069)
- [Inventory 2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/inventory-2-208668)
- [Status 2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/stats-2-206959)
- [Dialogue 2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/dialogue-2-218635)

- Input System
- Burst
- All the Examples from GC2, Stats 2, Inventory 2, Dialogue 2 and Quest 2

### Additional Requirements
Some of the examples will also require some custom Actions, Conditions and Triggers that can be downloaded from the [Game Creator Hub](https://gamecreator.io/hub)
I will try to list the ones I use here as I come up with them.
