# GameCreator2 Simple Extensions
In this respository I will upload code I use in Game Creator 2 that cannot be uploaded to the Hub.

A few of the extensions are:
- Extended Unit Driver controllers for the Player and Characters
- Input Usage actions
- Micro Extensions or Micro Modules
  - Simple Melee (Broken)
  - Simple Dialogue
  - Simple Pause

Things I will not include:
- Instructions uploaded to the Hub
- Game Creator 2 Core code, or code in the official modules

## Requirements
To take advantage of Simple Extensions for Game Creator 2 you will need the following:
- Unity 2022.3 LTS
- [Game Creator 2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/game-creator-2-203069)

To be able to use the sample demos, you will need the following:
- Blockout package from Game Creator 2

### Additional Requirements
Some of the examples will also require some custom Actions, Conditions and Triggers that can be downloaded from the [Game Creator Hub](https://gamecreator.io/hub)

Explanation Video (Comming up...)

NOTE: it's not meant to be full featured, for a full featured Dialogue module I suggest to get Dialogue 2 module for Game Creator 2.

### Simple Melee MicroModule (Broken for now)
With this Module it should be a bit easier to implement some basic Melee for your game.

NOTE: it's not meant to be full featured, for a full featured Melee module I suggest to get Melee 2 module for Game Creator 2.
